This vignette demonstrates a modern workflow for processing Sentinel-2 
Level-2A data from the EOPF (Earth Observation Processing Framework) STAC API.

The Earth Observation data landscape is rapidly evolving, with EOPF positioning 
itself as a key component of this transformation. There is a strong industry 
movement towards adopting Zarr, a modern cloud-native data format designed for 
efficient storage and access of large multi-dimensional arrays. While the 
tooling ecosystem around Zarr and EOPF-Zarr specifically is still maturing, 
this vignette provides a practical example of working with these data formats 
using the `vrtility` package.

This vignette also demonstrates contemporary approaches to cloud-masking
and image compositing using [OmniCloudMask](https://github.com/DPIRD-DMA/OmniCloudMask) 
and the geometric median algorithm, respectively.


This example prioritizes data quality and modern processing methods over raw 
speed, demonstrating how to generate analysis-ready data using contemporary 
cloud-native workflows.

We also demonstrate a powerful new feature of `vrtility`: the ability to create 
derived bands using `vrt_derived_block()`. This feature enables you to generate 
spectral indices (such as NDVI and EVI) and other derived metrics directly within 
the VRT framework. Under the hood, it uses [muparser](https://github.com/beltoforion/muparser) 
expressions executed through VRT pixel functions, providing efficient computation 
without requiring intermediate file storage.

## Prerequisites

This workflow requires specific system dependencies that may need additional setup:

1. **EOPFZARR GDAL Plugin**: You'll need to build and install the 
[EOPFZARR plugin](https://github.com/EOPF-Sample-Service/GDAL-ZARR-EOPF) to read 
EOPF-Zarr formatted data.

2. **muparser Support**: Your GDAL installation must include muparser support 
for derived band calculations. You can verify this by running: `vrtility::check_muparser()`.

## Query the EOPF STAC API

This example demonstrates the standard workflow for discovering and filtering 
satellite imagery through a STAC (SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog) API. We'll 
query the EOPF STAC collection and apply filters to obtain the specific 
datasets we need.

The process involves:
1. Querying the STAC collection for available imagery
2. Filtering by cloud coverage to ensure data quality
3. Applying coverage filters to guarantee sufficient spatial overlap

In this example, we're targeting a bounding box around Copenhagen, Denmark, 
and using `stac_coverage_filter()` to ensure we only retrieve images with 
adequate coverage of our area of interest.

```{r setup }
library(vrtility)

bbox <- gdalraster::bbox_from_wkt(
  wkt = "POINT (12.56 55.67)",
  extend_x = 0.3,
  extend_y = 0.2
)

te <- bbox_to_projected(bbox)
trs <- attr(te, "wkt")

eopf_s2 <- stac_query(
  bbox = bbox,
  stac_source = "https://stac.core.eopf.eodc.eu/",
  collection = "sentinel-2-l2a",
  start_date = "2025-05-01",
  end_date = "2025-07-30"
)

eopf_filter <- rstac::assets_select(
  eopf_s2,
  asset_names = c("B02_10m", "B03_10m", "B04_10m", "B08_10m")
) |>
  stac_cloud_filter(max_cloud_cover = 30) |>
  stac_coverage_filter(bbox, min_coverage = 0.5)
```

## Download and warp the images

Here we virtually warp the images and then download them to disk using multiple
processes within an isolated set of mirai daemons. Note that we call `mirai::daemons()`
within the `with()` function to ensure that the daemons are properly cleaned up
after use.

Critically, we must specify the `driver = "EOPFZARR"` argument in 
`vrt_collect()` because GDAL will, by default, attempt to read the files using
the built-in Zarr driver, which does not fully support the EOPF-Zarr format.

Note the use of `lazy = FALSE` which will materialize the warped images to disk;
this will make data access and subsequent processing more efficient.

```{r download-imgs}
with(mirai::daemons(10), {
  eopf_s2_chgn <- vrt_collect(
    eopf_filter,
    vsi_prefix = "/vsicurl/",
    driver = "EOPFZARR"
  ) |>
    vrt_warp(
      t_srs = trs,
      te = te,
      tr = c(10, 10),
      lazy = FALSE
    ) 
})
```

## Cloud masking 

Here we generate an OmniCloudMask for each image in the VRT collection using the 
red, green, and NIR bands. The cloud mask identifies pixels affected by clouds, 
cloud shadows, and other atmospheric interference. We then apply this mask to 
filter out low-quality pixels and compute the results to disk.

Note that we use `recollect = TRUE` to return a new VRT collection that 
references the newly created cloud-masked GeoTIFF files, allowing us to continue 
working with the data in a virtualized format for subsequent processing steps.


```{r cloud-masking, out.width="50%"}
eopf_s2_mask <- eopf_s2_chgn |>
  vrt_create_mask(
    inbands = c(red = 3, green = 2, nir = 4),
    maskfun = create_omnicloudmask()
  ) |>
  vrt_set_maskfun(
    mask_band = "omnicloudmask",
    mask_values = 1:3
  ) 

purrr::walk(
  seq_len(eopf_s2_mask$n_items),
  ~ plot(eopf_s2_mask, item = .x, c(3, 2, 1), na_col = "#ffa928")
)
```

## Geometric median composite

Here we generate a geometric median composite from the cloud-masked images using 
`multiband_reduce()` with the `geomedian()` function. The geometric median is a 
robust statistical method that effectively reduces noise and preserves spectral 
characteristics while minimizing the influence of outliers and residual cloud 
contamination.

We use `mirai::daemons()` to parallelize the computation across multiple cores, 
significantly improving processing speed for this computationally intensive operation.



```{r geomedian}
with(mirai::daemons(10), {
  eopf_s2_median <- multiband_reduce(
    eopf_s2_mask,
    reduce_fun = geomedian(),
    outfile = fs::file_temp(ext = ".tif"),
    recollect = TRUE
  )
})

plot(
  eopf_s2_median,
  c(3, 2, 1),
  na_col = "#ffa928"
)
```


## Derived bands

Spectral indices are essential tools in remote sensing for extracting meaningful 
information from multi-band imagery. Common indices like NDVI (Normalized 
Difference Vegetation Index), EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index), and others help 
identify vegetation health, water content, and other surface characteristics.

The `vrtility` package provides `vrt_derived_block()` for efficient creation of 
these derived bands. This function uses R's intuitive formula syntax to define 
band calculations, which are then automatically translated to muparser 
expressions and executed using VRT pixel functions. This approach provides 
memory-efficient computation without requiring intermediate file storage.

In this example, we'll calculate several useful indices and visualize the results:

```{r derived-bands, out.width="50%"}
exptest <- vrt_derived_block(
  eopf_s2_median,
  ndvi ~ (B08_10m - B04_10m) / (B08_10m + B04_10m),
  ndti ~ (B04_10m - B03_10m) / (B04_10m + B03_10m),
  evi ~ 2.5 * (B08_10m - B04_10m) / (B08_10m + 6 * B04_10m - 7.5 * B02_10m + 1),
  vgnirbi ~ (B03_10m - B08_10m) / (B03_10m + B08_10m)
)

print(exptest, pixfun = TRUE)

x <- vrt_compute(
  exptest,
  outfile = fs::file_temp(ext = ".tif")
)


purrr::walk(
  1:4,
  ~ plot_raster_src(
    x,
    band = .x,
    minmax_def = if (.x == 3) c(-1, 1) else NULL,
    col = grDevices::hcl.colors(10, "Inferno")
  )
)
```
