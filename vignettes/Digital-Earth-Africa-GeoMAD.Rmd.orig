Sometimes, amazing people do all the work for you! Digital Earth Africa has [a 
lot of amazing data available](https://docs.digitalearthafrica.org/en/latest/data_specs/index.html)
but the datasets that are (in my opinion) particularly special and, in large 
part, motivated the creation of vrtility (so that we can get some of the 
[Open Data Cube](https://opendatacube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) functionality
in R) are the [GeoMAD](https://docs.digitalearthafrica.org/en/latest/data_specs/GeoMAD_specs.html)
datasets. These are (sub)annual geometric median composites of Landsat and 
Sentinel-2 archives for Africa. You can access these data in all manner of ways,
but here is how you can do it with vrtility.

Some nice advantages of using vrtility here is - parallel asynchronous downloads
and convenient organisation of the multiple bands into a single raster file. 

This is also a classic use case for the VRT format, combining multiple tiles 
into a single file 😀.

## Getting started

So let's get into it. First load vrtility and then set the number of mirai 
daemons you want to use (R processes that will download the data in parallel).

```{r setup}
library(vrtility)

mirai::daemons(5)

```

## Locating the data

To locate the data, we need to define a bounding box. First we need this bbox 
in lat-long coordinates for querying the STAC API, but we can project these
bounds later. For convenience, we'll use this handy function to create
a bounding box from a WKT point and extend it by a certain amount in the x and
y directions. This location is in North of Madagascar.

```{r locate-data}
bbox <- gdalraster::bbox_from_wkt(
  wkt = "POINT (46.33 -15.9)",
  extend_x = 0.22,
  extend_y = 0.2
)
```

## Querying the data

We can now query the STAC API for the Landsat 8 and 9 annual composites for 2024.
The `stac_query()` function will return a `doc_items` object which we can
use to build our VRT objects. This can be optionally filtered, as shown below,
if you don't need all of the assets (bands).

```{r query-data}
l8l9_query <- stac_query(
  bbox = bbox,
  stac_source = "https://explorer.digitalearth.africa/stac/",
  collection = "gm_ls8_ls9_annual",
  start_date = "2024-01-01",
  end_date = "2024-12-31"
)

# This step is optional - do this if you only want a subset of the assets (bands)
l8l9_query <- rstac::assets_select(
  l8l9_query,
  asset_names = c("SR_B2", "SR_B3", "SR_B4", "SR_B5")
)
print(l8l9_query)
```

## Collecting the data

So now we can use the core vrtiltiy functions to collect, reproject and align
(warp) the data before using `vrt_compute()` to create a single raster file
from the VRT. Note that we set set some important environment variables in
`vrt_collect` that will allow you to access the Digital Earth Africa data from 
the S3 bucket.

```{r collect-data}
l8l9_vrt <- vrt_collect(
  l8l9_query,
  gdal_config_opts(
    AWS_NO_SIGN_REQUEST = "YES",
    AWS_S3_ENDPOINT = "s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com"
  )
)

print(l8l9_vrt)

# if you just want to look at one of the tiles...
# plot(l8l9_vrt[[1]][[2]], c(3, 2, 1))

bbox_proj <- bbox_to_projected(bbox, l8l9_vrt$srs)

l8l9file <- vrt_warp(
  l8l9_vrt,
  t_srs = attr(bbox_proj, "wkt"),
  te = bbox_proj,
  tr = c(30, 30)
) |>
  vrt_stack() |>
  vrt_compute(engine="gdalraster", recollect=TRUE)
  

```

## Plotting the data

Let's have a look at the data in both true colour and false colour.

```{r dea-geomad-plot, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%", fig.cap= ""}
  plot(
    l8l9file,
    bands = c(3, 2, 1)
  )

  plot(
    l8l9file,
    bands = c(4, 3, 2)
  )
```
