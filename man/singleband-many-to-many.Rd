\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{vrt_collection_warped} object. All images must be aligned to the
same grid (use \code{\link[=vrt_warp]{vrt_warp()}} first).}

\item{m2m_fun}{A function that operates on time series data. The function
receives a matrix where rows represent time steps and columns represent
pixels, and must return a matrix of the same dimensions. See \code{hampel_filter}
for an example. Calculations are performed independently for each band.}

\item{outfile}{Output file path(s). Can be a single path (used as template)
or a vector of paths (one per time step). Defaults to temporary files.}

\item{config_options}{A named character vector of GDAL configuration options.
See \code{gdal_config_opts()}.}

\item{creation_options}{A named character vector of GDAL creation options for
output files. See \code{gdal_creation_options()}.}

\item{quiet}{Logical. If \code{FALSE}, displays a progress bar during processing.}

\item{nsplits}{Integer specifying the number of spatial tiles to process. If
\code{NULL} (default), automatically determines optimal tiling based on input
dimensions, available memory, and number of parallel workers.}

\item{recollect}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, returns a \code{vrt_collection} object
containing the processed images. If \code{FALSE} (default), returns a character
vector of output file paths.}

\item{k}{The number of neighboring points to consider on each side of the
current point. window length 2*k+1 in indices.}

\item{t0}{threshold, default is 3 (Pearson's rule), see below.}

\item{impute_na}{Logical indicating whether to impute NA values. If \code{TRUE},
the function will impute NA values using the nearest prior non-NA value. If
\code{FALSE}, NA values will be returned in their original positions.}
}
\value{
If \code{recollect = FALSE}, a character vector of output file paths (one
per time step). If \code{recollect = TRUE}, a \code{vrt_collection} object.

A function to be used with \code{singleband_m2m()} to remove outliers
from a raster time series.
}
\description{
Apply temporal operations to each pixel's time series in a
warped VRT collection. This function processes each band independently,
applying a user-defined function across the temporal dimension (e.g.,
filtering outliers, smoothing, gap-filling).

\code{hampel_filter} is used tocreate a function to filter band-level
outliers in time-series using the Hampel filter. to be provided to
\code{singleband_m2m()}.

\details{
\subsection{Processing Model}{

\code{singleband_m2m()} materializes the virtual raster collection by:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Spatial tiling}: Divides the spatial extent into tiles for efficient
memory usage
\item \strong{Band-wise processing}: For each band and tile, extracts the complete
time series (all images)
\item \strong{Temporal operations}: Applies \code{m2m_fun} to the time series matrix
(rows = time, cols = pixels)
\item \strong{Output writing}: Writes filtered results to disk as GeoTIFF files
}
}

\subsection{Common Use Cases}{
\itemize{
\item \strong{Outlier removal}: Remove cloud contamination or sensor artifacts using
\code{\link[=hampel_filter]{hampel_filter()}}
\item \strong{Temporal smoothing}: Apply moving average or median filters
\item \strong{Gap filling}: Interpolate missing values in time series
\item \strong{Temporal compositing}: Create median/mean composites while preserving
all time steps
}
}

\subsection{Performance Considerations}{
\itemize{
\item Processing is parallelized if \code{mirai} daemons are active (see
\code{daemons}\link[mirai:mirai]{mirai::mirai}).
\item Automatic tiling balances memory usage against I/O overhead
\item Each output image retains original metadata (timestamps, band descriptions)
\item Use \code{recollect = TRUE} to chain with additional VRT operations
}
}

(details from the \code{pracma::hampel}) The ‘median absolute deviation’ computation is
done in the (-k...k) vicinity of each point at least k steps away from the
end points of the interval. At the lower and upper end the time series values
are preserved.

A high threshold makes the filter more forgiving, a low one will declare
more points to be outliers. t0<-3 (the default) corresponds to Ron Pearson's
3 sigma edit rule, t0<-0 to John Tukey's median filter.

The implementation of the hampel filter is based on the pracma package but
implemented in C++. It also handles NA values differently, First, NA values
are removed from the data before applying the filter. If \code{impute_na} is
\code{TRUE}, the function will impute NA values using the nearest prior non-NA
value. If \code{impute_na} is \code{FALSE}, NA values will be returned in their
original positions.
