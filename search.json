Using mirai daemons allows automated speed several vrtility processing steps. Next define area interest, using gdalraster package can easily simply provide numeric vector (length 4) lon/lat coordinates ordered xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax. working raster data often convenient use projected coordinate system. bbox_to_projected function provides convenient way reproject bounding box, either specific spatial reference system (SRS) using default SRS appropriate area interest. default SRS equal area projection centered around centroid bounding box. Now need find data. need query HLS Landsat Sentinel-2 collections. hls_stac_query function provides convenient way . First query HLS Landsat collection. set maximum cloud cover 35% date range 2023-01-01 2023-12-31. can see total 70 images, 6 less 35% cloud cover. now query HLS Sentinel-2 collection using parameters. can see < 10% images less 35% cloud cover. order download data need set Earthdata credentials. simplest way earthdatalogin package. , using asynchronous mirai daemons, need set credentials daemons. Now can begin forming VRT pipeline. “collect” assets STAC collections. essentially just list virtual rasters. can take little time due VRT validation - however, GDAL caching makes re-accessing remote files faster, subsequent parts workflow. print method vrt_collection objects gives us high level overview imagery download. collections contain images two different SRS. can also see number bands differs across two collections. Now need align data can composite imagery one go. can simply adding nodata bands required. case HLS Landsat collection, also need move position cirrus band match HLS Sentinel-2 collection. Similarly, HLS Sentinel-2, need add thermal bands absent, critically, note need specify scale value bands. isn’t provided scale first band used (case 0.0001) scale, ignored. Automating tricky miss appropriate scale, see warnings use vrt_stack. Now can combine two collections single collection using c method. simple concatenation two collections. Now set mask function required HLS data. “Fmask” band true bitmask (unlike datasets may use ineger masks). Therefore must use build_bitmask function set mask can specify bits wish set -data across bands. Now want “reduce” imagery collection single composite image. typical approach use band-level median can achieve easily first creating virtual warped raster collection using vrt_warp stacking warped collection using vrt_stack. can now apply python median pixel function using vrt_set_py_pixelfun computing final composite using vrt_compute. However, can also create composites using advanced statistical methods can improve filtering outliers, increase scene consistency ensure spectral properties preserved. Several functions provided vrtility package user can also provide desired. use geomedian function calculates geometric (aka spatial median). synthetic statistic ensures consistency across bands. Note can also use functions medoid quantoid, geomedoid obtain different types composite preserve spectral properties data. theory can also just run: NASA Earthdata server seems object multiple concurrent reads single file can bit slow. Therefore can download multiple files parallel using “warp” engine vrt_compute(). downloads files locally - can build geomedian composite . warping vrt_compute step can align images collection spatial reference system, extent pixel size. particularly important case multiple SRS values collection. note recollect = TRUE set ensure returned object vrt_collection object, FALSE multiple file paths returned instead. Now let’s take look composite - first RGB false colour composite.  bands :","code":"library(vrtility)  mirai::daemons(gdalraster::get_num_cpus())  bbox <- gdalraster::bbox_from_wkt(   wkt = \"POINT
